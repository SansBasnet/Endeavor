## TimeSeries forecasting using ARIMA model and Retrieval-based Chatbot


This repo contains two projects 

(1) A time-series influenza cases forecasting using ARIMA/sARIMA model </br>
(2) A retrievel-based chatbot using IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding API. 

---------

AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Avergage or ARIMA is a widely used forecasting model in stock price prediction. ARIMA implements three primary parameteres (p, d, q) to make a prediction based on historical trends. <b>p</b> is the number of lag observations included in the model, aka the lag order, <b>d</b> is the count on the raw observations that are differentiated, aka the degree of differencing, and <b>q</b> is the size of the moving average window, aka order or MA. 

This is a sample of work, I undertook to predict influenza cases in the future such that our users (EMS and Fire Departments) are able to make decisions based on these models.
